Students are given a zipped file "flag101.zip"

Keep unzipping the file until flag is extracted

You can also write a bash for loop to help you, I have included my script for your reference

You will see 45 45 43 54 46 7b 41 72 33 5f 79 30 75 5f 37 31 72 33 64 3f 7d in the flag

Convert it to ascii

Flag: *EECTF{Ar3_y0u_71r3d?}*
